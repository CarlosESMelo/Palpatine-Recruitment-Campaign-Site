# Palpatine-Recruitment-Campaign-Site
This project is a site that was made with the lessons of Programador Br course of Web Development (https://programadorbr.com/).

It's the first site that I made.

The site is organized with basic CSS and HTML. And the intention was to track email marketing for Darth Sidius, a character of Star Wars Universe. 


The Result: https://carlosesmelo.github.io/Palpatine-Recruitment-Campaign-Site/
