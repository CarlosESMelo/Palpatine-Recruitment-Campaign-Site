# Palpatine-Recruitment-Campaign-Site
This site was made with the lessons of Programador Br course of Web Development (https://programadorbr.com/).

It's the first site that I made for tracking email marketing and data with the forms of HTML and creating the design of the site in CSS based in the classes.

The Result: https://carlosesmelo.github.io/Palpatine-Recruitment-Campaign-Site/
